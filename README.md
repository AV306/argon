Some other utilities for the block game.

[Xenon](https://github.com/AV306/xenon)'s spiritual successor for newer versions!

## Old features

- ProximityRadar (rendering currently non-functional)
- Timer
- HealthDisplay (planned)
- Panorama Generator (planned)
- Portal GUI unlock (planned)
- Infinite chat length (planned)

## ✨New features✨
- AutoTools (planned) (because the original AutoTool mod hasn't been updated)
- Display external mods in ModuleList (planned)
- Movement while in inventory (planned)

## Mods to use to replace Xenon features
- Zoom: WI-Zoom
- WAILA: Jade
- FullKeyboard: [OnlyKeys](https://github.com/jaszlo/OnlyKeys)
- ShareLocation: HereNThere
- FullBright: any fullbright mod of your choice

## TODO

- use YACL instead of CompleteConfig
- port OnlyKeys to 1.21.6 and PR back
- comment out rendering from ProximityRadar
- add FeatureList/CommandProcessor foreign mod handling
